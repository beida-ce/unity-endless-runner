## Endless Runner Game (Unity)

![Gameplay](Gameplay.gif)

An endless runner-style game developed using **Unity and C#**.

This project was built to practice **gameplay programming**, **clean code structure**, and **core Unity systems**.

### 🎮 Gameplay
- Continuous forward movement
- Jump mechanics to avoid obstacles
- Procedurally spawned obstacles
- Score system based on distance/time

### 🛠️ Technologies
- Unity
- C#
- Rigidbody-based physics / CharacterController

### 🧠 Technical Focus
- Player movement and input handling
- Basic game state management
- Prefab-based obstacle spawning
- Simple UI integration
- Event-driven logic

### 📂 Project Structure
The project follows a modular folder structure that separates player logic, game managers, obstacles, and UI components to improve readability and maintainability.

### 🚀 Purpose
This project is part of my portfolio and showcases my ability to design and implement a small but complete Unity project with a clear structure and scalable codebase.

### 🔍 Notes
- Designed to be easily extendable with new mechanics
